# Trends in particulate matter pollution throughout the United States: understanding the effects of renewable energy investments on air quality

Analysis tool: R

This is the final group project of the course "Environmental Data Analysis." We gathered the data from EPA and used R to analyze 19-year county-level particulate matter data over the U.S. to discover the temporal and spatial air pollution pattern. Both parametric and non-parametric trend tests were conducted. As for spatial analysis, kNN, Kriging, and local regression methods were tested to see if there is any presence of a specific spatial pattern for the particulate matter in the United States. The results suggested that PM pollution is more a local than a regional/national issue. In the second part, we linked the air pollution trend to the USDA government investment in energy efficiency to examine the effects on air quality improvement. The results showed that the investment may have partial impact on air quality, while it requires further investigation to distinguish the numerous potential influencing factors.
