The two datasets, "PM2.5 FRM/FEM Mass (88101)" and "PM10 Mass (81102)", are the ones we use. Download the year from 1999 to 2017. Then change the file name into this format: "pm*number*_*year*" (e.g., "pm25_2017", "pm10_1999").


##USDA Investment Data

There are several sheets in the excel document. The one called "Detailed" is what we use. Save this sheet as a .csv file named 'EnergyInvestments_DataDownloads.csv', and change the format of all columns into "general".
Run the following code:
```{r}
invest_year <- read_csv('EnergyInvestments_DataDownloads.csv') %>%  
  rename(state = "State", county = "County", year = "Year", amount = "Total Amount of Assistance")%>%
  select(State, county, year, amount)

write.csv(invest_year, file = "invest_year.csv")

```
And you will get the file used in the investment analysis.
